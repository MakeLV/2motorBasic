2motorBasic
===========

A basic 2-motor sketch to show how easy it is to move things with an Arduino and motor shield.

This code assumes the Adafruit Motor Shield or equivalent and the AFmotor library available here:

You can build your own equivalent shield using the schematics at the above link.
